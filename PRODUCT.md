# Organizador

<!-- impeccable:product-schema 1 -->

## Platform

Windows desktop

## Stack

Delegated: Python 3.13, PySide6, watchdog and SQLite FTS5. This stack was chosen
because the app must run quietly in the Windows tray and monitor local folders
without requiring a server or administrator access.

## Users

The primary user is a university student who downloads notes, slides,
assignments and notebooks throughout the day and wants those files organised
without repeatedly navigating Windows Explorer.

## Product Purpose

Organizador moves eligible completed downloads into a safe university inbox,
asks for the relevant subject and document type, and files the document in the
right folder. It also keeps subject-linked tasks and makes PDF, modern Office,
text and notebook contents searchable. Success means the Downloads folder no
longer becomes an accidental archive and every move remains understandable and
reversible.

## Positioning

The app joins file-system automation with a fast human confirmation step. It
does not silently guess where important coursework belongs: it proposes a
destination, learns only after repeated confirmed choices, and preserves an
undo trail.

## Operating Context

- The app runs in the Windows system tray.
- Chrome, Edge and Firefox may create temporary download files before renaming
  them to their final name.
- Files are organised under a user-selected university root, initially proposed
  as `Documents\Universidade`.
- Subject folders are divided into Slides, Exercícios, Testes, Trabalhos and
  Outros.
- The interface is Portuguese (Portugal).

## Capabilities and Constraints

- Only configured study-oriented file extensions are monitored.
- Files must be complete and unlocked before the app moves them.
- The app never overwrites or deletes a user file.
- All filing operations are logged and the latest filing can be undone.
- PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, text and notebook search is local and does not upload
  documents.
- Scanned image-only PDFs require future OCR support and are not searchable in
  the first version.
- Existing files in Downloads are not moved automatically on first launch.
- Learned suggestions require at least two matching confirmed filings, abstain
  when choices conflict, and never bypass human confirmation.

## Evidence on Hand

There are no supplied brand assets or production datasets. UI examples and
empty states must not be presented as real university data.

## Product Principles

- Never lose or overwrite coursework.
- Ask once, then make the common action very fast.
- Keep all document contents on the user's computer.
- Prefer a visible inbox over an uncertain automatic classification.
- Treat learned patterns as suggestions, never as permission to file silently.
- Remain useful even when the main window is closed.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

Primary actions must be keyboard-accessible, state must not rely on colour
alone, and Portuguese copy must name both the problem and the recovery action.
